# sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the field of study that analyzes peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from a text. In analyzing short informal texts, such as tweets, blogs or comments, it turns out that the emoticons provide a crucial piece of information. However, emojis have not been exploited so far, and no resource with emoji sentiment information has been provided.

# Sentiment of Emojis
There is a new generation of emoticons, called emojis, that is increasingly being used in mobile communications and social media.
In the corpus, probably the largest set of manually annotated comments, some of the comments contained emojis. The sentiment of the emojis was computed from the sentiment of the comments in which they occur, and reflects the actual use of emojis in a context.
Such a corpus-based approach can be used for an automated corpus construction for feature generation, and then applied to train a sentiment classifier.
